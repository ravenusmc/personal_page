            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops

              <h1>Mike's Weather App</h1>
              <p class='early_para'>This project allows the user to find the weather in their location based on the Weather Underground API. I originally built this project when I was in the Coding Bootcamp Tech Talent South. However, my version, of the project, never fully worked when I was doing the bootcamp. Almost a year later, I came back to the project, rebuilt it all from the ground up and then launched it on Heroku. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, Weather Underground API</b></p>

                <p class='early_para'>Like the Weather App above, this was another project that was originally built during my time at Tech Talent South. However, the project was never finished and again, about a year later, I came back to it and started all over. The project allows you to find the closet MARTA bus/train stop to you using the MARTA API. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, MARTA API</b></p>

                <h1>Come Together</h1>
                <p class='early_para'>I think, out of all the projects on this page, this is the one project that I may be most proud of. Come Together was essentially my final project at Tech Talent South. I worked with two other people on it and at the time we never finished it. Over a year later, when I really dived into Rails, I decided to rebuild all of the project. I did not think that I would actually be able to do it but I prevailed! Esssentially, what Come Together allows the user to do is find out there people, within a certain radius of them to meet up. So, if people in a neighborhood wanted to have a specific club and communicate about that club, this app will allow them to do it. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, Ruby on Rails, Geolocation gem</b></p>

                <h1>Personal Blog Site</h1> 
                <p class='early_para'>This is my personal blog where I not only talk about world events but cover ideas in philosophy as well as what the future may be like. I also have my coding blog with the link in the footer section. This was originally going to be my home page but the HTML and CSS on it really appear outdated. I don't really work with Ruby on Rails anymore so I am not updating/maintaining the page. However, I do like to keep it for two main reasons. The first is that it is one of my two blogs. The second is that it demonstrates how far my skills have come since it was launched at the end of 2015. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Boot Strap, Ruby on Rails</b></p>
