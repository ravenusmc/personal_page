            In a past life I was an intelligence officer and before that an officer in the Marine Corps. I spent most of the 2000's, after college, on deployments to the Middle East. However, before all that, in the late 90's when I was in high school I loved technology. I was part of the U.S. FIRST Robotics team. My friends and I were known as the nerds of our high school class. I would spend my Friday evenings not partying or hanging out at a friends house. Instead, I checked out documentaries on physics from David Goodstein who teaches at CalTech. In my Senior of high school I started to do some programming and made a basic text based adventure. The screen changed color at certain times and I even had the computer beeping at specific moments! However, when I went to the University of California at Davis, I became a History and Political Science double major. I figured that I would make a career in the Marine Corps and a History degree would serve me well. In late 2013 I was watching some videos on Khan Academy about history which I loved to do. On this particular day, the site mentioned that they had some computer programming videos. I decided to check them out and for some reason, I clicked on one about Python. I slowly started to learn about Python and then in the spring of 2015 took a coding boot camp at <a class='tech_talent_anchor' href="https://techtalentsouth.com/">Tech Talent South</a>. From there, my knowledge and passion for the art has exploded.

              <h1>Mike's Weather App</h1>
              <p class='early_para'>This project allows the user to find the weather in their location based on the Weather Underground API. I originally built this project when I was in the Coding Bootcamp Tech Talent South. However, my version, of the project, never fully worked when I was doing the bootcamp. Almost a year later, I came back to the project, rebuilt it all from the ground up and then launched it on Heroku. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, Weather Underground API</b></p>

                <p class='early_para'>Like the Weather App above, this was another project that was originally built during my time at Tech Talent South. However, the project was never finished and again, about a year later, I came back to it and started all over. The project allows you to find the closet MARTA bus/train stop to you using the MARTA API. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, MARTA API</b></p>

                <h1>Come Together</h1>
                <p class='early_para'>I think, out of all the projects on this page, this is the one project that I may be most proud of. Come Together was essentially my final project at Tech Talent South. I worked with two other people on it and at the time we never finished it. Over a year later, when I really dived into Rails, I decided to rebuild all of the project. I did not think that I would actually be able to do it but I prevailed! Esssentially, what Come Together allows the user to do is find out there people, within a certain radius of them to meet up. So, if people in a neighborhood wanted to have a specific club and communicate about that club, this app will allow them to do it. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, Ruby on Rails, Geolocation gem</b></p>

                <p class='early_para'>This is my personal blog where I not only talk about world events but cover ideas in philosophy as well as what the future may be like. I also have my coding blog with the link in the footer section. This was originally going to be my home page but the HTML and CSS on it really appear outdated. I don't really work with Ruby on Rails anymore so I am not updating/maintaining the page. However, I do like to keep it for two main reasons. The first is that it is one of my two blogs. The second is that it demonstrates how far my skills have come since it was launched at the end of 2015. <b>Skills used: HTML, CSS, Boot Strap, Ruby on Rails</b></p>

                      This project uses a news api to allow the user to see news articles that cover information from around the world. I created it so each page is a different category of news. The first page is general, tech, business and Video games.

                      This project looks at Homicides that have occurred in the U.S. since 1980. It will allow the user to see such data points as how many murders were committed by male/female, which years had the greatest number of murders and a graph of all the homicides since 1980.

                      This project is similar to the Murder study project except that it looks at UFO data. I also focused much more on using D3.JS in it to make the graphs and other visual data aspects of it much more appealing.

                      This project's purpose was to look at war data from wars that the U.S. has been involved in. It is nothing to in depth-basically looking at the wounded and dead. The project did use a lot of technology though: Pandas, React, D3.JS, Flask just to name a few!

                    <p>
                      This project examined data that was about the RMS Titanic. It mainly allowed the user to see who lived or died on the ship once it sank. I will say that the data appeared 'weird' to me in the sense that I do not believe it was a full list of everyone who was on the ship.

                    <p>
                      This project was designed to review Mongo DB. I have always wanted to make an inventory system-I did a lot of inventory management during my time in the Marine Corps and in the government. So, why not develop a basic inventory system to track toilet paper. Yeah, that's right, toilet paper! I may yet make this into a web site using flask!

                  <div>
                    <p>
                      This project only had one purpose-to start to learn how to use Angular. Overall, it went rather well. It is a simple site, three pages essentially, with a lot of lorem ipsum. At the same time that I was making this site I was also learning some new web devevlopment techniques from my web development class. Thus, I was reviewing subject matter as I learned a little bit about Angular building this project.

                    <p>
                        This project uses data about the world, such as GDP, infant mortality etc, and allows the user to see the data visually. It uses the command line which I really do not like. It was one of the last projects that I made before I started to switch my data science projects over to Flask. If you like International Relations then this is a project you may want to take a look at!

                    <p>
                      If one were to look at my Github repo they would see quite a few terrorism projects there. This is one of those projects. There is a lot of terrorism data on Kaggle-the site that I go to get a lot of my information. I also believe that this was my first Flask project, start to finish, using Pandas. After this, a majority of my data science projects moved from a command line format to the web.
